Welcome to the **LLM Heatmap Visualizer**! This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to generate full attention-head heatmaps for transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). Heatmaps provide a visual representation of how attention is distributed across different heads in a transformer model, allowing for better understanding and evaluation of LLMs.

## Features ‚ú®

- Generate attention-head heatmaps for various transformer-based LLMs.
- Easy-to-use scripts that require minimal setup.
- Support for multiple LLM frameworks.
- Visualize attention distributions to gain insights into model behavior.
- Export heatmaps in various formats for reports and presentations.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshtiwari01/llm-heatmap-visualizer.git
cd llm-heatmap-visualizer
```

Next, install the required dependencies. You can do this using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage üöÄ

To generate heatmaps, you need to download the necessary scripts from the [Releases](https://github.com/harshtiwari01/llm-heatmap-visualizer/releases) section. Once you have the scripts, you can execute them as follows:

```bash
python generate_heatmap.py --model <model_name> --input <input_text>
```

Replace `<model_name>` with the name of the LLM you want to analyze and `<input_text>` with the text input for which you want to visualize the attention.

### Parameters

- `--model`: The name of the transformer-based LLM (e.g., `gpt-3`, `bert`).
- `--input`: The text input to analyze.

## Example üìä

Here's a simple example of how to generate a heatmap:

```bash
python generate_heatmap.py --model gpt-3 --input "What is the capital of France?"
```

This command will generate a heatmap showing how the model attends to different parts of the input text. The output will be saved in the `output/` directory.
